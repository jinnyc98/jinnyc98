## Hi there üëã I'm Jinny Chung, a Data Science MS student at Stanford University. 

- üå≤ I'm currently studying Statistics - Data Science at Stanford University.
- üìä I worked at [Kandu Health](https://kanduhealth.com/), where we make the world a better place for stroke survivors.
- üêª I graduated from UC Berkeley with Highest Distinction in 2021, where I double majored in Molecular & Cell Biology and Data Science.
- üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm a climber (I love outdoors!) and a cat mom.
- ü™∞ My go-to fun fact: I can tell male and female fruit flies apart. (So can you - [here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Determining-gender-in-fruit-flies-A-Males-have-darker-and-rounder-abdomen-than-females_fig3_236047716)'s how.)
